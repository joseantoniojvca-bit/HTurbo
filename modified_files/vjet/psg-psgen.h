  /// \brief Abstract class for defining the generally used phase 
  /// space algorithm.
  /// 
  /// The general idea is that building the process dependent phase 
  /// space generators from simple algorithm like RAMBO, SARGE. These 
  /// algorithms usaualy generate a phase space configuration with a given 
  /// number of outgoing monenta at fix center-of-mass energy. This 
  /// abstract type provides a possible protocol to define these algorithm 
  /// and use them in a same way.
  /// \param _Lv is a Lorentz vector type template parameter.
  /// \param _OutputIterator is an output iterator type template parameter 
  /// which can iterate (point to)  the \b _Lv Lorent vector type variables.
  /// To get more information about the iterators see the Standard C++ 
  /// reference manual.
  /// \see International Standard, Programming Language -- C++, ISO/IEC 14882 \n
